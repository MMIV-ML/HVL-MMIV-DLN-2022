# Getting started

## Communication
All students have been given access to the course Discord server via a link shared through email. 

## Software installation
* You will be able to work through most of the course material using free cloud resources. However, for learning purposes, we recommend installing Python locally on your computer. One of the easiest ways is to install the Anaconda Python distribution. Instructions here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
* If you haven't used Python before you can may consider exploring DataCamp. You will be sent a link that gives you free 6-month access to all of DataCamp. The link will be shared on the course Discord server.

## Learning material
* We'll rely heavily on Jupyter Notebooks. For a basic introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eCHD6f_phE and the many tutorials you'll find via Google. 
* Go through the course repo and have a look at the various Jupyter Notebooks already available. Feel free to try running them yourself. 
* To get a head start, read a bit about the [Team project](../team_project).

## Asking questions / troubleshooting

Use the course Discord server. It's best if you post in the #general channel so that you can help each other. @Alexander and @Arvid  will also be available throughout the course.
