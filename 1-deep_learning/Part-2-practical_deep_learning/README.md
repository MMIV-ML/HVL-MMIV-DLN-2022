# Part 2: Practical deep learning and deep learning engineering


## Introduction

This part of the module takes you on a guided tour through some of the landscape of practical deep learning. See the accompanying lecture slides for an overview of the content.

We'll meet the idea that non-image data can be turned into images that can be fed to computer vision-based models, use the fact that deep neural networks are representation learners to extract _task-specific representations_ of data, indicate the importance and usefulness of _fusing_ multiple sources of data when constructing predictive models, try out some basic techniques from _explainable AI_, stress the importance of _domain knowledge_ for data augmentation, and more.

We'll end by discussing an often underappreciated but crucial aspect of deep learning and machine learning more generally: the many parts necessary to actually _deploy_ a machine learning-powered system and thus give it actual impact beyond a proof-of-concept research stage. In other words, what's sometimes called _machine learning engineering_.
