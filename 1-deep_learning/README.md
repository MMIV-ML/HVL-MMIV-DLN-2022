# Deep learning

This module will introduce some core features of deep learning, provide hands-on experience with some application areas, and do a guided tour of some valuable tools and techniques of practical deep learning in biotechnology and medicine. 

The module has two parts:

## Part 1: The building blocks of neural networks
Part 1 will be an introduction to deep learning, essentially from scratch. The main takeaway and learning outcome will be that
> _Deep learning is a search for good hierarchical representations..._

...that makes a given task easy to solve. The goal is to have everybody on board with this helpful description of deep learning and provide hands-on experience with how this translates into computer code (using PyTorch) via some concrete, simple examples.

Get started here: [Part 1: Building blocks](./Part-1-building_blocks/). 

## Part 2: Practical deep learning and deep learning engineering
In Part 2, we'll change gears and fly through more involved examples. The goal is to expose you to some of the many ideas, techniques, and tricks in modern deep learning. Those who are new to the field will hopefully get a useful impression of **practical deep learning**, with some pointers for learning more. Others more experienced in deep learning will perhaps learn new tricks and be exposed to exciting approaches and applications. Finally, part 2 will include a look at how practical deep learning is part of _software engineering_, i.e., **deep learning engineering**, and what it takes to develop deep learning-based software solutions that go beyond a _proof-of-concept_-stage.
