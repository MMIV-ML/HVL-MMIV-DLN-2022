# About the project pitch

Imagine that you're participating in a quick-fire session where research funding agencies or investors are screening ideas for potential financial support. 

At the event, each participant gets _5 minutes_ to pitch an idea. If you pass the screening process, you move on to a second round where a more extensive, written project description is assessed. (Note that this is an imagined part of the process: the actual course event will have no second round*).

Here's how your pitch should be framed:

> Given what you now know about the material of the course, do you have any ideas, either concrete or more like visions, for how you could incorporate the topic(s) in your own Ph.D. project or research? If not, then how about your field more broadly?
 
---
(*) _However, you'll get some practice with writing such descriptions in the course [Team Project](../team_project)._


## Requirements
* It's up to you how you give your pitch. Slides, no slides, video, animations, you decide. But remember that 5 minutes go by very quickly!
* _Boldness_: We encourage you to be bold! Go for the most ambitious version of your ideas.
* _Feasibility:_ ...but also keep in mind that your project has to be at least somewhat feasible. Point to 2-3 literature references to indicate attainability.

## Practicalities
* You'll present your pitch to the lecturers and your fellow students of the course on the first day in Bergen. See the course schedule for details.
* We will have to stop you after 5 minutes.
